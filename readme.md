## TODO
- css styling
    - banner
        - homebutton (image) -> need logo for this
    footer
        - socials links
    - need a brief description of how software works (eg: only pulls from diary, uses letterboxd)
- add stars onto posters (add ratings onto text field instead?)
- add user's full name instead of username on generated image option (checkbox)
- add caching for movie posters
    - use shared memory/multiproccessing to handle cacheing
    - i wrote cache.py as an LRU cache with deque and set. Need to make instance of it and share between server.py and a worker process for proper caching
- change right side of image so it resizes based on max text length
- change font?
- implement database and decouple front-end and back-end
